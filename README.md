# SHA512 PopClip Extension

A complicated way to print hashed sha512 text.

## What it does?

It will get the selected text and will append an UNIX epoch time hashed in SHA512 to it. After that it re-hash it again using the same algorithm.

## Why

When I can't find the "delete account" button, I feed fake data into my account to try to keep my identity secure.
